A desktop application for visually building and composing UI components on an interactive canvas. Drag components from the sidebar, connect them, preview live HTML/CSS output, and export or generate code.

Version: 1.0.0

## Why This App

> This app is built for developers and designers who want to quickly assemble UI layouts using pre-built components. Instead of writing boilerplate code or switching between multiple tools, you can drag components onto a canvas, see live previews, connect them, and generate clean HTML/CSS output. It includes built-in tools for creating color palettes, text gradients, mesh gradients, and a UI component studio.

## How It Works

```text
+------------------+
|   Sidebar Panel  |
|  (Components +   |
|   Tools + Import)|
+--------+---------+
         |
  drag & drop / click
         |
+--------v---------+
|                  |
|    Canvas Area   |
|  (nodes, zoom,   |
|   pan, connect)  |
|                  |
+--------+---------+
         |
 connections link
 nodes together
         |
+--------v---------+
|                  |
|  Generate Window |
| (HTML/CSS output |
|  syntax highlight)|
+------------------+
```

The application has four main sections:

- Sidebar: Contains categorized components (20 categories, 200 components), a Tools section (Color Palette, Text Gradient, Mesh Gradient, UI Component Studio), and My Imports for saved imports.
- Canvas: The main workspace where components are placed, positioned, scaled with zoom/pan, and connected with visual links.
- Tools: Built-in generators accessible from the sidebar that can send output directly to the canvas.
- Generate Window: Produces the combined HTML/CSS code of all connected nodes in your canvas.
